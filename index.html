    <h1>Brynden Tully</h1>
    <img src="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/d/de/Blackfish.jpg" alt="">
    <div>Ser Brynden Tully is the brother of Lord <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hoster_Tully">Hoster Tully</a> of <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riverrun">Riverrun</a>. Though younger than his brother by five years, Brynden and Hoster were close during their childhood. Brynden was eventually knighted, and fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, gaining fame and renown throughout the kingdom. However, Brynden's relationship with his brother was severely strained after Hoster attempted to betroth Brynden to Bethany Redwyne. Brynden refused the match, and all offers made afterwards. The brothers began to argue more and more, and during one such fight, Hoster called Brynden the "black goat of the Tully flock". Pointing out that their sigil was a trout, Brynden stated that he would be a black fish rather than a black goat. Taking a black trout as his personal sigil, Brynden was known as the Blackfish ever since.</div><br>
    <div>Brynden remained at Riverrun, where he was like a secondary father figure to Hoster's children and ward. When Hoster's younger daughter Lysa married Lord Jon Arryn during Robert's Rebellion, Brynden informed his brother that he had taken service with Arryn. Hoster considered this to be a personal rejection, and refused to speak Brynden's name thereafter. After Robert's Rebellion ended, Brynden left for the Eyrie, where he served as Knight of the Gate until the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings. Frustrated with Lysa's refusal to give aid to her father and brother at Riverrun, which is endangered by the armies of House Lannister, Brynden joins Lysa's sister Catelyn and her son, Robb Stark, and soon gains a prominent position in Robb s army</div><br>
